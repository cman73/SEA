A small scheduler simulator used in SEA practices at ISTY.
==========================================================

This is the sources that are given to the students, which are incomplete.
In the current state the simulator is not complete and does not produce
statistics or show scheduling issues.

The complete simulator sources with the expected answers are available
on request by sending me a mail at pablo@sifflez.org (except if you are one
of my students :-)
